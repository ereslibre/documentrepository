HOW TO INSTALL
==============

- Configure documentrepository/protected/config/console.php
            documentrepository/protected/config/main.php
  to connect to the database with username and password.

  Also configure 'documentRepository' param at the end of
  the file.

- Run manually on MySQL:
    create database whatever;

- Move to documentrepository/protected/data
    mysql -u myuser -p whatever < schema.mysql.sql

- Move to ..
    ./yiic.php migrate

- Soft link your 'documentRepository' target on
  documentrepository/repository, so your images and documents
  are accessible by the application.

That's pretty much all. Have fun !
